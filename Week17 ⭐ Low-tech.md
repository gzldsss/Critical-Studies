Low-tech is technology that is simple, inexpensive and does not rely heavily on advanced or complex electronic equipment. It usually involves the use of basic tools, manual processes and simple machines to accomplish tasks. In a world where everyday life is full of modern high technology, low-tech wants to express a return to nature and tradition. In the development of today's cities, people are developing modern high technology while using some of the same traditional, back-to-nature scientific and technological achievements and products.

Low-tech solutions are often more accessible, affordable and easier to maintain than high-tech solutions. They are often used in situations where resources are scarce. Low-tech devices and solutions can have a positive impact on social life, as they often require people to work together, collaborate and interact face-to-face. They can facilitate social interaction and community building, which are essential to our well-being.

The Low-tech Lab is a collaborative platform and community that promotes the development and use of low-tech solutions to address environmental and social challenges. It was founded in 2013 in France by a group of engineers, designers and activists who wanted to explore alternative technologies and innovative approaches that are more sustainable, accessible and suitable for resource-poor environments.

I visited the Low Tech Lab website where I could learn to make handmade toilets, make handmade yoghurt and a host of other things that I would use in my life. I think this is not only a great way to make our lives more environmentally friendly, sustainable and back to nature, it is also a great way to make people feel calmer, which is a great way to relieve stress and make people feel happier.

At the same time, the Low-tech Lab is a great way to promote the idea of low-tech, to get more people on board and to discover that low-tech is a fun way of life, especially for people who like to do their own crafts. It can also bring about better relationships, including family relationships, friendships and so on, as many things can be made with many people joining in, and when people are immersed in something together, they bond more closely.

But it has its limitations, only people with a leisurely lifestyle are suited to it, and in a country where life is very fast, most people don't have the time to make something handmade. He also wants resource-poor areas to learn how to make some of the objects on this page, but there are some tools such as toilets that resource-poor areas don't even have enough money to buy the raw materials for. So I think it is geared more towards people with enough money and time rather than resource poor areas.

In general I want low-tech to be more accepted, I think it's a very meaningful concept, it strengthens the connection between people and the environment.

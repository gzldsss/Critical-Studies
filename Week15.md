I walked into this gallery on a rainy day. The gallery was small and there were not many exhibits, so I could take my time to view the works. All the pieces in this exhibition were very modern and had a distinctive personal touch.

The piece that struck me the most was an installation called IN REAL LIFE, a huge house covered in silver tinfoil, shaped like a Teletubbies room with a protruding Teletubbies-like prism at the top of the house and a silver table and chairs inside. Outside there is a table with a delicate silver stamp on it. I like the feeling it conveys to me, for me it is a quirky and mysterious yet childlike piece. I like the clumsy presentation because something too delicate would not have this primitive and mysterious air. And I love anything shiny, and the silver tinsel really catches my eye.

When I see it I can imagine a lonely hut with its lights on in a starry Arctic sky. Inside sits a creature unknown to us, which is researching its subject. Perhaps it is recording unknown cultures, engraving them into a silver seal that will record them. Or perhaps it is the last descendant of their race on this world, and it wants to leave its mark on this earth for those who come after it to discover. Perhaps he was a mad scientist who was unearthing the untold secrets of this world, and those silver stamps are all relics of his discoveries.

The combination of the look of this work and his name makes it somewhat grotesque, as it does not look like a building that exists in real life. So this work gives me a little more of a feeling of loneliness, and the fact that it is placed in the centre of the gallery makes it even more lonely. It is more like an inner world than a reality, the inner world of a lonely, quiet, somewhat out-of-touch person.

I looked up the author's awards on the internet. And found other works by the author.

"Learning skills such as blacksmithing and casting metal creates links with the past and helps me understand the origins of my own practice. Now confident in forging metal, I am experimenting with infusing these ancient techniques with a contemporary outlook. I am interested in mixing other materials with my metalwork, intertwining skills and exploring new combinations. A sense of humour and a genuine interest in connecting with people through my art plays an equally important role" is a quote from his profile, so he combines new art forms with old techniques to create this unique style of work. He is very keen to look into the crafts of the past, such as smelting or flint knapping, which I think is a very rewarding thing to do and it allows more people to see the beauty of traditional craftsmanship. It has given me a lot of inspiration to learn some of the old crafts and art styles and blend them with my own style, which makes me more satisfied with my work.
